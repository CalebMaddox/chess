1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. d4 O-O { Interesting that the King-side of black ends up in the same position as the Sicilian, but Fischer forgoes c5 and Nc6. Read that Fischer was going for "Hypermodern", knew that Byrne attacked center, Fischer was giving him the center and attacking via the diagonals.
Green - controlled by White. Red - controlled by Black. e4 is attacked by both the black and white knight, so leaving it unmarked. Fischer's ahead in defense. His King is protected. } { [%csl Ge5,Gg5,Gd5,Gc5,Gb5,Rg4,Rf5,Gd4,Gf4] } 5. Bf4 d5 { Why no cxd5? } 6. Qb3 { White has three attackers on d5. Black has two defenders. } (6. cxd5 Nxd5 7. Nxd5 Qxd5 8.

Aside from the uncastled King and the undeveloped white bishop. His front line, center control, looks so choice. } 9. Rd1 Nb6 10. Qc5 Bg4 { [%cal Gg4d1] } 11. Bg5 { Preventing Nfd7 } 11...
